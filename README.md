# Deep Learning

This is a github repository that I am using to keep python code related to Deep Learning. 

## Description

The repository contains code snippets and examples of deep learning and Neural Nets. They are stored here for my own use and reference. Some of the files are sources for Binder.org projects.

## Binder Projects
The Bear Classifier is interactive and is available at this Binder link
